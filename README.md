# Customer Segmentation
## Project Overview & Learning Goals
**What we're building:** A system that analyzes customer purchase behavior to group customers into segments and predict how much each customer will be worth over time.

**Why this matters:** Companies use this to decide marketing budgets, identify VIP customers, and prevent churn.

**Skills you'll learn:** Python data analysis, SQL basics, statistical concepts, machine learning, and business storytelling.
