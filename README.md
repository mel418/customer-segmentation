# Customer Segmentation & Lifetime Value Analysis

Build a complete customer analytics pipeline using an e-commerce dataset (like the Online Retail dataset from UCI). Create RFM analysis, customer segments using clustering algorithms, and predict customer lifetime value. This hits statistical modeling, clustering, and retail analytics directly.

## Project Overview & Learning Goals
**What we're building:** A system that analyzes customer purchase behavior to group customers into segments and predict how much each customer will be worth over time.

**Why this matters:** Companies use this to decide marketing budgets, identify VIP customers, and prevent churn.

**Skills you'll learn:** Python data analysis, SQL basics, statistical concepts, machine learning, and business storytelling.
